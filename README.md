# System Programming Concepts

## Overview

This repository is designed to help you **learn and practice Linux system programming concepts** through hands-on code examples and organized documentation. It focuses on how the Linux kernel handles low-level operations such as memory management, process control, file systems, inter-process communication (IPC), and more.

Whether you're a student, systems developer, or enthusiast, this repository provides a practical foundation for understanding how modern operating systems work at a low level.

## What Is System Programming?

**System programming** refers to writing software that directly interacts with the operating system and hardware. Unlike application programming, it emphasizes **efficiency, control, and low-level access** to system resources.

### Common Uses:
- Developing operating systems, kernels, and bootloaders
- Writing device drivers and embedded firmware
- Creating performance-critical or real-time applications
- Building tools like compilers, debuggers, and profilers
- Implementing security and monitoring tools

### Key Knowledge Areas:
- C/C++ and Assembly programming
- Operating system internals (Linux)
- Process and thread management
- Virtual memory and memory protection
- File system access and permissions
- Synchronization and IPC (e.g., pipes, signals, shared memory)

## Kernel Responsibilities Overview

### File Management (File System Management)
The kernel uses a **Virtual File System (VFS)** to provide a consistent interface for file operations across file systems like `ext4`, `Btrfs`, and `XFS`. It handles:
- Creating, reading, writing, and deleting files
- Directory structure and navigation
- File permissions and metadata
  > See Examples in the `File-Management.md` file.

### Memory Management
The kernel manages both **physical RAM** and **virtual memory**, handling:
- **Paging** between RAM and swap space
- **Memory protection** between processes
- Virtual address space mapping for each process
  > See Examples in the `Memory Management.md` file.

### Process Management
The Linux kernel is a **multitasking** system that controls process creation, scheduling, and termination. It manages:
- Process lifecycle (`fork()`, `exec()`, etc.)
- CPU scheduling
- Process states: running, sleeping, zombie
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
 > See Examples in the `Process Management.md` file.

### Threads
Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space. They allow:
- Efficient multitasking within a process
- Fast, shared communication  
> See thread examples in the `Threads.md` file.

### Signals
Signals are software interrupts used for:
- Notifying processes of events like termination or user interrupts
- Handling runtime errors like segmentation faults
- Inter-process signaling

### IPC Mechanisms (Inter-Process Communication)
IPC enables processes to exchange data and synchronize. Common methods include:
- **Pipes**: One-way communication between related processes
- **Message Queues**: Managed queues for asynchronous communication
- **Shared Memory**: Fastest method, allowing multiple processes to access a common memory space  
> See IPC examples in the `Process Management.md` file.
