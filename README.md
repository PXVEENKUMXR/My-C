# ðŸ”§ Linux Kernel Subsystems & File Operations in C

This repository provides a hands-on introduction to Linux **kernel subsystems** through practical C programs demonstrating **low-level file operations** using system calls like `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and more.

These programs are intended for students, system programmers, and Linux enthusiasts who want to understand how system calls interact directly with various kernel components.

## 1. Overview of Linux Kernel Subsystems

The Linux kernel is modular and consists of several key subsystems:

- **VFS (Virtual File System)** â€“ unified interface for all filesystems.
- **Scheduler** â€“ manages process execution and CPU time.
- **Memory Manager** â€“ handles physical and virtual memory.
- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** â€“ enables processes to exchange data.
- **Networking Stack** â€“ manages sockets and protocols.
- **Device Drivers** â€“ control access to hardware.

## 2. File Operations via System Calls

Linux provides low-level system calls for file manipulation, allowing direct interaction with the kernel. These operations bypass the standard C library (`stdio.h`) and use:

- `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`
- `lseek()`, `stat()`, `unlink()`, etc.

These are essential for:
- Embedded systems
- Real-time applications
- OS and kernel-level development

### 3.1 Virtual File System (VFS)

The VFS abstracts access to various filesystems (ext4, FAT, tmpfs). All file operations go through this layer.

**Example:**
```c
int fd = open("file.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);
write(fd, "Hello", 5);
close(fd);
