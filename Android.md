# Android

## What is Android?
[cite_start]Android is a mobile operating system developed primarily by Google, and it is used on a wide range of devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, TVs, automotive displays, and even some home appliances[cite: 3]. [cite_start]It is built on top of the Linux kernel, which provides the foundation for managing hardware like the CPU, memory, and device drivers[cite: 4].

## Key Characteristics of Android

* [cite_start]**Type**: Android is an Operating System (OS), which means it manages all the hardware and software components of a device[cite: 6]. [cite_start]It acts as a bridge between the physical hardware and the applications that users interact with[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]**Based On**: Android is based on the Linux kernel, which is a well-known, robust, and open-source kernel used in many server and desktop systems[cite: 8]. On top of that, Android includes many other open-source libraries, such as:
    * [cite_start]`libc`: A standard C library used for system-level programming [cite: 10]
    * [cite_start]`WebKit`: A browser engine used to display web pages in apps [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**User Interface (UI)**: Android’s user interface is designed primarily for touch-based interaction[cite: 12]. [cite_start]Users interact with apps using gestures like tapping, swiping, pinching, and scrolling[cite: 13]. In addition to touch, Android also supports:
    * [cite_start]Voice input (via Google Assistant or other tools) [cite: 14]
    * [cite_start]Gesture-based navigation [cite: 15]
    * [cite_start]Accessibility support like TalkBack, screen readers, and magnification [cite: 16]

## Programming Languages Used in Android
[cite_start]Developers can build Android apps and system components using multiple programming languages, each with a specific role[cite: 18]:

* **Java**:
    * [cite_start]Initially the main programming language for Android application development[cite: 20].
    * [cite_start]Apps run on the Android Runtime (ART) or previously the Dalvik Virtual Machine[cite: 21].
    * [cite_start]Many core Android APIs are written in Java[cite: 22].
* **Kotlin**:
    * [cite_start]In 2017, Google announced Kotlin as the officially recommended language for Android development[cite: 24].
    * [cite_start]Kotlin is more concise, safe, and modern compared to Java[cite: 25].
    * [cite_start]Fully interoperable with Java (you can mix both in the same project)[cite: 26].
* **C/C++**:
    * [cite_start]Used mainly for low-level system components and performance-critical native applications[cite: 28].
    * [cite_start]Developers use the Android NDK (Native Development Kit) to write parts of an app in C/C++ (e.g., for games or audio processing)[cite: 29].

## Device Categories that Use Android
[cite_start]Android is not limited to smartphones[cite: 31]. It powers a wide range of smart and embedded devices, including:

* [cite_start]Smartphones (e.g., Samsung, OnePlus, Pixel, Vivo, Realme) [cite: 32]
* [cite_start]Tablets (e.g., Samsung Galaxy Tab, Lenovo Tab) [cite: 33]
* [cite_start]Smart TVs (Android TV and Google TV platforms) [cite: 34]
* [cite_start]Wearables (Watches running Wear OS) [cite: 35]
* [cite_start]Automotive Displays (Android Auto and Android Automotive OS) [cite: 36]
* [cite_start]Smart Devices (fridges, speakers, projectors, etc., via Android Things or custom Android) [cite: 37]

[cite_start]Android is a powerful, flexible, and open-source mobile operating system[cite: 38]. [cite_start]Its Linux-based architecture, support for multiple programming languages, and adaptability across device types have made it the most widely used OS in the world for mobile and smart devices[cite: 39].

## History and Origin of Android (Detailed Explanation)
[cite_start]The story of Android is one of innovation, open-source philosophy, and global adoption[cite: 41]. [cite_start]Here's a breakdown of how Android started and became the most widely used mobile OS in the world[cite: 42].

### 2003 – The Birth of Android Inc.
[cite_start]Android Inc. was founded in October 2003 in Palo Alto, California[cite: 44].

* [cite_start]**Founders**: Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]**Initial Goal**: Develop software for digital cameras to allow users to upload photos to cloud storage[cite: 46]. [cite_start]However, they soon realized the mobile phone market was more promising[cite: 47].
* [cite_start]Pivoted to building a flexible and open-source mobile OS to compete with existing systems like Symbian and Windows Mobile[cite: 48].

### 2005 – Google Acquires Android
[cite_start]In August 2005, Google acquired Android Inc. for approximately $50 million[cite: 50].

* [cite_start]All four founders joined Google[cite: 51].
* Android was kept secret at first; [cite_start]Google quietly worked on building an open mobile platform[cite: 52].

### 2007 – Open Handset Alliance (OHA) is Formed
[cite_start]In November 2007, Google publicly unveiled Android as part of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of hardware manufacturers, software developers, and mobile carriers[cite: 54].

* **Founding members included**:
    * [cite_start]HTC, Samsung, Sony, LG [cite: 56]
    * [cite_start]Motorola [cite: 57]
    * [cite_start]Qualcomm, Texas Instruments [cite: 58]
    * [cite_start]Sprint, T-Mobile, Vodafone [cite: 59]
* [cite_start]**Goal**: Create a free, open-source platform for mobile devices that would encourage innovation and reduce fragmentation in the mobile world[cite: 60].

### 2008 – First Android Phone Launched
[cite_start]The first Android smartphone was the HTC Dream, also known as the T-Mobile G1, released in September 2008[cite: 62].

* It included:
    * [cite_start]Touchscreen + physical QWERTY keyboard [cite: 64]
    * [cite_start]Access to the Android Market (now Google Play) [cite: 65]
    * [cite_start]Built-in Google apps like Gmail, Maps, YouTube [cite: 66]
* [cite_start]It showed the potential of Android, despite being basic by today’s standards[cite: 67].

### Core Technologies Introduced:
* [cite_start]**Linux Kernel**: Android is built on top of the Linux kernel (just like Ubuntu or Red Hat), giving it stability, hardware control, and process management[cite: 69].
* [cite_start]**Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)**: Android apps were initially run in the Dalvik VM, which allowed multiple apps to run efficiently on low-memory devices[cite: 70]. [cite_start]Later, Dalvik was replaced by ART (Android Runtime) for better performance[cite: 71].

## What Was Used Before Android?
[cite_start]Before Android’s rise, the mobile world had several competing operating systems, most of which were proprietary, closed-source, and not designed for modern touch interaction[cite: 73].

[cite_start]The major ones[cite: 74]:

### 1. Symbian OS
* [cite_start]**Used By**: Mainly Nokia, also by Sony Ericsson and others[cite: 76].
* **Features**:
    * [cite_start]Multitasking [cite: 78]
    * [cite_start]Customizable UI [cite: 79]
    * [cite_start]Good for non-touch phones [cite: 80]
* **Limitations**:
    * [cite_start]Poor touchscreen support [cite: 82]
    * [cite_start]Difficult to develop for (complex SDK) [cite: 83]
    * [cite_start]Closed development process [cite: 84]
* [cite_start]Symbian began to lose ground around 2010 when Nokia failed to transition fast to touchscreen phones[cite: 85].

### 2. Java ME (J2ME)
* [cite_start]**Used In**: Low-end feature phones (basic phones, not smartphones)[cite: 87].
* **Features**:
    * [cite_start]Lightweight apps (games, SMS tools) [cite: 89]
    * [cite_start]Runs on very limited hardware [cite: 90]

    * [cite_start]Not a full operating system [cite: 92]
    * [cite_start]No multitasking or deep hardware access [cite: 93]
    * [cite_start]No app store; users installed .jar files manually [cite: 94]
* [cite_start]Java ME apps were common in the 2000s, but the platform wasn’t designed for rich apps or internet connectivity[cite: 95].

### 3. Windows Mobile
* [cite_start]**Developed By**: Microsoft[cite: 97].
* [cite_start]**Used In**: HTC, Motorola, Dell Axim, and other PDAs[cite: 98].

    * [cite_start]Outdated UI [cite: 104]
    * [cite_start]Not consumer-friendly [cite: 105]
* [cite_start]Microsoft later replaced it with Windows Phone, but it failed due to poor app support[cite: 106].

### 4. BlackBerry OS
* [cite_start]**Used By**: BlackBerry (formerly RIM)[cite: 108].
* **Features**:
    * [cite_start]Full QWERTY keyboards [cite: 110]

    * [cite_start]Weak multimedia and app ecosystem [cite: 115]
    * [cite_start]Not attractive to general consumers [cite: 116]
* [cite_start]BlackBerry was dominant in business, but couldn’t adapt to the app-centric smartphone revolution[cite: 117].

### 5. Palm OS
* [cite_start]**Used By**: Palm devices like Palm Treo[cite: 119].
* **Features**:
    * [cite_start]Early stylus UI [cite: 121]
    * [cite_start]Personal organizer tools [cite: 122]
